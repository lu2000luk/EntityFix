Fixes a bug in Minecraft 1.21 that can let players crash servers with an item in their inventory.

## Informations
I am NOT a Java developer by any means. I barely know how to display Hello World. This is the second plugin i made it can be really buggy, if you find anything wrong open an Issue or even better fix it and make a pull request.
